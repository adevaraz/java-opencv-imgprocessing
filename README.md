# Java OpenCV Image Processing
This project is made in order to learn image processing using OpenCV in Java.
## Getting Started
In this project, I use Eclipse as IDE and implement several image processing such as filtering, noise, morphology, edge detection, etc.
### Prerequisites
To try run this project, there are several things you need to install :
* JDK 15. I download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) and install it. Maybe [this steps](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-DAF345BA-B3E7-4CF2-B87A-B6662D691840) could help.
* Eclipse EE. I download the IDE [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).
* JavaFX 11. Download from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) and follow the step to setup in Eclipse from [here](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/) on menu JavaFX and Eclipse.
* OpenCV 4.4.0. Download it from [here](https://opencv.org/opencv-4-4-0/) and for set up in Eclipse, follow the steps from [this link](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d1/d0a/tutorial_java_eclipse.html).
